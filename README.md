This repository contains my Master’s dissertation project at Dublin Business School, focused on predictive modeling and sports analytics in the Indian Premier League (IPL). 🏏
 
### Project Name: PREDICTIVE MODELING AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS IN CRICKET.

### 📌 Project Overview

- Analyzed 250,000+ IPL match deliveries (2008–2022) using Python.
- Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis on batting, bowling, fielding, and team performance across seasons.
- Engineered new features and prepared the dataset for modeling.
- Built a machine learning pipeline (ColumnTransformer + One-Hot Encoding + Logistic Regression).
- Achieved 81% accuracy in predicting match outcomes.
- Delivered real-time win probabilities after each over.

### 🔮 Future Scope

- Integrating real-time match data (via API/web scraping).
- Including external factors (weather, injuries).
- Developing an interactive web app for predictions.
